### OPAL at UCLH

Early in the year we deployed [elCID](http://elcid.openhealthcare.org.uk) - our custom built digital service for 
infection doctors to University College London Hospital.

Despite our early plans for a cautious, staggered rollout, demand from end users to transition to the system meant
that we accellerated rapidly, spreading throughout the division of infection at UCLH and racing through the 1000 patient 
mark within the few months.

Not content to sit on our laurels, we've been further developing the platform, with a specialist OPAT (Outpatients 
Antimicrobial Therapy) service developed and launched early 2015, and a walk-in clinic service scheduled for 
deployment in spring.

### OPAL for research

2014 saw the first academic outputs from the OPAL project, with two posters presented at the 
[Federation of Infection Societies](http://www.fis-infection.org.uk/) conference. 

Demonstrating the new capabilities for conducting clinical audits and exploring hypotheses about the patient 
population treated by UCLH, concluding that: 

    The electronic prospective data capture benefits of elCID have facilitated organisation
    and interrogation of our own clinical practice to greater levels than before, describing 
    many hitherto uncaptured elements of clinical activity.


### Hackdays

2014 saw the [NHS Hack Day](http:/nhshackday.com) train roll in to Cardiff, London and Leeds. As ever
the events saw us take multidisciplinary groups of Doctors, Technologists & Patients for a weekend of 
furious hacking, resulting not only in some great new projects, but in hundreds of individual opportunities
for people to connect & learn from each other.

Particularly exciting were [TB Care Plan](https://github.com/huwlynes/tb_care_plan) - a single page TB guideline
project that managed to take the rule of "As simple as it can possibly be" to new heights, and a 
[Renal focussed](https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal-renal) OPAL implementation for handover and patient management.

### The Future

2014 has been a great year for Open Health Care, & We're excited looking forward to the year to come !

With new product launches, lots of exciting projects in the pipeline, as well as the relentless programme of running 
events up & down the country, we'll be busy!
