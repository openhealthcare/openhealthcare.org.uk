Calling all friends of [NHS Hack Day](http://nhshackday.com): 

We're[ having a meet up](https://attending.io/events/nhshd-10-meetup-times) on Thursday 16 April, and we'd love to see you there ! 

We're going to be in the George Inn near London Bridge from 18:00, and
we'd love to talk to people about not just the 
[upcoming NHS Hack day](http://openhealthcare.org.uk/blog/2015/03/17/nhs-hack-day-10/), 
but also any of the other ways that technology and data can make the NHS better, 
make new friends, & even start planning how to make some of those ideas a reality!

<b>Where:</b> [The George Inn](https://attending.io/events/nhshd-10-meetup-times#map)

<b>When:</b>  Thu 16 April 2015 18:00-21:00

<b>Who:</b> Anyone & everyone ! All welcome, no specialist skills or knowledge required...

<b>How:</b> Just turning up is fine, but you can also add yourself to our [event page](https://attending.io/events/nhshd-10-meetup-times).

If you're thinking of attending NHS Hack day, have a good NHS related problem that you want to
see solved, or are just curious as to what all this is about, this is
a great event for you! We'll have the [@NHSHackDay](http://twitter.com/nhshackday) team on 
hand, and we're excited to hear your great ideas ahead of the event next month!
