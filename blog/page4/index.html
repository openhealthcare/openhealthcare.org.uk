          <div class="post-entry">
            <p>At Open Health Care, we believe in
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design">User-centered design</a>.</p>

<p>Which means that we focus on meeting the needs of our users, and is why we
always work in close collaboration with them. Whether that comes in the
form of making sure that our clinical champions are present at every sprint
meeting, or working hard to get clinical staff and patients along to
<a href="http://nhshackday.com">NHS Hack Day</a> we work by putting users first, building
and testing in small chunks.</p>

<p>Working this way means that generally when we work on a project, we identify
clinical champion(s) for that project. These are the kind of people who will use the service
we end up building in their day-to-day work. In order to get them as involved as
possible, we introduce them to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile">Agile</a>,
and we often find ourselves teaching <a href="https://github.com/GabPoll">doctors</a> to
<a href="https://github.com/michaeledwardmarks">github</a>. (Yes, that&rsquo;s a verb now).</p>

<p>The great thing about working in multidisciplinary teams, is that <em>everyone</em> learns
new things, all the time. For every medical three letter acronym like say,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-acquired_pneumonia">CAP</a> that gets explained
to a developer, there&rsquo;s an explanation of what
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a> stands for that goes the
other way.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not just terminology that gets shared - often we try to share our tools. We
promote online
<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/docs/about/">collaborative</a>
<a href="http://hackpad.com/">document</a> editing above email attachments and
<a href="http://thedoghousediaries.com/5964">naming conventions</a>. We encourage users to take
up better web browsers. We get them to try out modern
<a href="https://slack.com/">team communication</a> <a href="http://appear.in">tools</a>, and recommend <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">Open Source</a>
alternatives to the proprietary default incumbents.</p>

<h3>But wait - it gets better</h3>

<p>Not only does this help us all understand one another better, which is so vital to delivering
high quality digital services, but it also often introduces clinicians to tools that reward
power users with advanced functionality. Once you&rsquo;ve learnt
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/">markdown</a> once, typing information
into text boxes that will get rendered in a web browser is never quite the same again. You start
<em>expecting</em> that the web based <a href="http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk">clinical digital services</a>
you use in your day job let you <a href="https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal/blob/823de649ddee6c13803264d929ece3ae171104c5/opal/static/js/opal/opaldown.js">use markdown</a>
there too.</p>

<p>Possibly the best feature we&rsquo;ve implemented that came about this way is the
<a href="http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk">OPAL </a>
Macros from
late last year. Directly inspired by <a href="https://github.com/blog/957-introducing-issue-mentions">Github issue mentions</a>,
OPAL Macros let the user define blocks of commonly used text, and then insert them with shortcut Macros -
(names preceded by the # symbol).</p>

<p>For instance, for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus">Staph</a> advice, the user enters #st:</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/images/features/macro.pre.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>&hellip; which then expands to the (institutionally defined) standard advice for this case:</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/images/features/macro.post.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is the kind of user need that only even comes up when users are digitally literate enough to
be able to express it - something along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote class="custom-quote"><p><i class="fa fa-user-md fa-3x"></i>
As a Doctor <br />
I want to avoid repeatedly typing out standard advice <br />
So that I can spend more time with my patients
</p></blockquote>


<p>The existence of this kind of power-user functionality encourages users to master their tools, by
offering them time savings and efficiencies but crucially, doesn&rsquo;t interfere with the user experience at all if you
don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s there. As
<a href="https://github.com/michaeledwardmarks">Dr Marks</a>, who had originally explained the need on
Github said:</p>

<blockquote class="custom-quote"><p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
Absolutely stunning.<br/>
I would say this is one of the most incredible things I have seen on a piece of NHS software ever.
</p></blockquote>


<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in starting an OPAL project at your institution to take advantage of this kind
of feature, or in seeing how we can can help you by providing clinical facing digital services,
don&rsquo;t hesitate to <a href="/contact.html">Get in touch</a>!</p>

            <p>Last week saw us excited to launch our new <a href="http://e-opat.com/">OPAT</a> (Outpatients
Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy) service delivered via the <a href="http://elcid.openhealthcare.org.uk">elCID</a>
platform at UCLH.</p>

<p>This is the first deployment of the specialist OPAT module for <a href="http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk">OPAL</a> -
our Open Source framework for building transactional digital services. It covers the whole range of an
OPAT service - from initial referrals and assessment, through ongoing care, post-treatment follow up and
review. All of the workflows capture high quality data at the time of use, and allow analysis and extraction,
both for reporting in line with national guidelines, and individual service audits.</p>

<p>As ever, we worked closely with clinical champions, who were deeply involved in the agile development process,
weighing in on <a href="https://github.com/openhealthcare/elcid/issues">GitHub</a>, attending sprint meetings, and
providing their expertise to our development team. The whole project is released under an Open Source (GPL)
license, and was developed in the open.</p>

<p>This was a project we loved delivering, and not just because of the high praise from Dr Jon Lambourne, UCLH&rsquo;s
clinical lead on the project, who said:</p>

<blockquote class="custom-quote"><p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
The Open Health Care team have been super, the things they can get the OPAL software to do regularly leaves me slack-jawed!
</p></blockquote>


<p>While we like to think that we&rsquo;re pretty good at executing on the technology side of things, it&rsquo;s really the collaboration
between us and the clinical users, along with our focus on their needs that makes it possible for us to deliver
new user-focussed digital services into the world.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we&rsquo;d particularly like to thank
<a href="https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/OurServices/Consultants/Pages/DrSarahLogan.aspx">Dr Sarah Logan</a> (Our consultant sponsor),
<a href="https://github.com/7575colli">Steve Collins</a> (OPAT Nurse extraordinaire), and
<a href="https://github.com/jonnylambourne">Dr Jon Lambourne</a> (Clinical lead on the project) for all their efforts.</p>

support running clinical OPAT services, don&rsquo;t hesitate to <a href="/contact.html">Get in touch</a>!</p>

            <p>Last weekend saw us return to Cardiff for the 9th NHS Hack Day - once again, with organisation
headed up by the life affirming <a href="https://twitter.com/amcunningham">Anne Marie Cunningham</a>.</p>

<p>NHS Hack Days are weekend events that bring together patients, healthcare and technology professionals and other
&ldquo;geeks who love the NHS&rdquo; under the banner of making NHS IT less bad. It&rsquo;s always exciting to see people discover
how digital products are made by &ldquo;Not Magic&rdquo;, not to mention the jaw-dropping that goes on when it gets explained
just how bad much of the status quo really is.</p>

<p>Many of the pitches highlighted the need for quickly and easily customisable hospital systems, that allow
people to collaborate more easily, and also to generate alerts and notifications, routing information that exists
within our institutions to the people who can actually make a difference with it, in time.</p>

<p>As the second day drew to a close, we all gathered together to share what we&rsquo;d made, and what we&rsquo;d learnt over
the weekend.</p>

<p>We thought that the team who rescued <a href="http://virtualmicroscope.readthedocs.org/en/hackday/">Virtual Microscope</a> -
a previously abandonned open source project for viewing, navigating &amp; annotate very high-resolution images deserved
huge credit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the group that took the Oculus Rift and turned it into an eye-test scenario complete with zombies seemed
like they had a whole world of fun !</p>

<p>In the end the grand prize went to Medboard - a system for connecting medical students to the classes &amp; opportunities
available to them at their respective institutions.</p>

<p>In addition, we were delighted to see our youngest ever attendee to an NHS Hack Day, with Ada Reynolds stealing the record at just
5 weeks old! Although she may have slept through much of this one, we&rsquo;re all looking forward to her contributions next time !</p>

<p>Next time looks like being London in May 2015 - although the venue &amp; exact date are yet to be confirmed. We&rsquo;d love it
if you joined us though - so do <a href="http://nhshackday.com">sign up to the mailing list</a> to be kept in the loop !</p>

            <h3>OPAL at UCLH</h3>

<p>Early in the year we deployed <a href="http://elcid.openhealthcare.org.uk">elCID</a> - our custom built digital service for
infection doctors to University College London Hospital.</p>

<p>Despite our early plans for a cautious, staggered rollout, demand from end users to transition to the system meant
that we accelerated rapidly, spreading throughout the division of infection at UCLH and racing through the 1000 patient
mark within the few months.</p>

<p>Not content to sit on our laurels, we&rsquo;ve been further developing the platform, with a specialist OPAT (Outpatients
Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy) service developed and launched early 2015, and a walk-in clinic service scheduled for
deployment in spring.</p>

<h3>OPAL for research</h3>

<div class="post-thumb">
  <img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/images/posts/elcid.outputs.png" alt="" />
</div>


<!--//post-thumb-->


<p>2014 saw the first academic outputs from the OPAL project, with two posters presented at the
<a href="http://www.fis-infection.org.uk/">Federation of Infection Societies</a> conference.</p>

<p>Demonstrating the new capabilities for conducting clinical audits and exploring hypotheses about the patient
population treated by UCLH, concluding that:</p>

<pre><code>The electronic prospective data capture benefits of elCID have facilitated organisation
and interrogation of our own clinical practice to greater levels than before, describing 
many hitherto uncaptured elements of clinical activity.
</code></pre>

<h3>Hackdays</h3>

<div class="post-thumb">

</div>


<!--//post-thumb-->


<p>2014 saw the <a href="http:/nhshackday.com">NHS Hack Day</a> train roll in to Cardiff, London and Leeds. As ever
the events saw us take multidisciplinary groups of Doctors, Technologists &amp; Patients for a weekend of
furious hacking, resulting not only in some great new projects, but in hundreds of individual opportunities
for people to connect &amp; learn from each other.</p>

<p>Particularly exciting were <a href="https://github.com/huwlynes/tb_care_plan">TB Care Plan</a> - a single page TB guideline
project that managed to take the rule of &ldquo;As simple as it can possibly be&rdquo; to new heights, and a
<a href="https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal-renal">Renal focussed</a> OPAL implementation for handover and patient management.</p>

<h3>The Future</h3>

<p>2014 has been a great year for Open Health Care, &amp; We&rsquo;re excited looking forward to the year to come !</p>

<p>With new product launches, lots of exciting projects in the pipeline, as well as the relentless programme of running
events up &amp; down the country, we&rsquo;ll be busy!</p>

            <p>
                We’re a limited company based in the UK.
                We work with clients in the NHS to help build a health system fit for the
                digital age.
                We build and run digital services for clinicians who deliver direct care
                and researchers who collect data.
                We also provide digital consultancy services to institutions within the health
                sector.
